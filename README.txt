This repository contains code to run 2 Markov Decision Process problems.

The repository is located at: https://github.com/jagrusy/MarkovDecisionProcesses

Both of the experiments are located in the src/main/java/mdp/ folder and
 are self contained with the experiment being in the main functions. 
 Parameters can be tuned by manually changing them in the main function.

It is best to use an IDE (I am using IntelliJ) that can pull in the dependencies of the project. 
This project uses the [Burlap library](https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap) along with examples from the 
[burlap_examples](https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap_examples) repository.
